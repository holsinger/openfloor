This is being sent to all free account owners on Beanstalk. 

We noticed a number of free accounts that are using Subversion over https (SSL), 
which is a feature for paid accounts only. With the new migration, we will be 
releasing an update on Saturday the 19th that will prevent free accounts from 
using the paid SSL option. 

To avoid disruption of service, please check your working copy and verify that 
you are using Subversion over http (hint: svn info). If you are using https, you 
will need to relocate your repository. To learn more about relocation, see this 
article:

http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/re27.html


STILL WANT SSL? $10 DISCOUNT!

If you'd like to continue using https and want to upgrade, we're offing a limited 
coupon for $10 off the first month, expiring on Monday the 21st. When upgrading, 
insert the coupon code KEEPSSL.

Upgrade at http://openfloor.beanstalkapp.com/account
