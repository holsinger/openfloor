As many of you know from our Tweets and blog post, we're migrating Beanstalk to Rackspace.
With the migration, we have a fully customized environment that will help us grow and expand
based on our specific hardware and architecture needs.

MIGRATION STARTING THIS WEEK

This week, we will start migrating the first set of accounts in batches of 1,000. Here is 
what you can expect:

1. An email to the owner and admins within three hours before it starts.
2. An email once it starts, which will block access while we migrate.
3. An email when it is finished. 

For most accounts, the migration should only take 10 - 30 minutes. For accounts that contain 
more data, it could take longer. Our plan is to migrate larger accounts during the weekend only 
to avoid outages during work hours.

MIGRATION NOTES

* A change to DNS is made, so it could take 10 minutes or longer to propagate. 
* The new servers run Subversion 1.6.4.
* The web interface will be a bit slow until we migrate all accounts, but SVN should be very fast.
* Email us right away if you think there is a problem at support@beanstalkapp.com.

We wrote a troubleshooting and FAQ article to help answer questions as well.

This migration is very exciting for us. We put a lot of effort into creating the ideal environment. It's 
been well tested and demonstrates excellent performance, so we are sure you will enjoy the update 
as well. As with any migration, issues will surely arise, so we will monitor the entire process and react 
quickly.

If you have questions or concerns, please email support@beanstalkapp.com.

Thanks,
Chris Nagele
Founder, Beanstalk
