Then he almost immediately began parlaying his own wealth, a network of his fellow Mormons and financiers, and his fund-raising role for the Republican Governors Association, into a national operation that quietly has signed up some of the biggest supporters of President Bush. Thus, although he remains the least known of the Republican front-runners, he has already locked up some of the most important donors. </p> </blockquote> <p>Romney didn't set out to raise funds.  <em>He bought the fund raising machine</em>.  Sure, the Bush administration has proven itself the sorriest bunch of losers who ever tried to govern something larger than a local garden club, but when it comes to fundraising and beating state Republican Parties into submission, the neocons excel.  </p>  <p>Romney's not running for president, he's <em>selling an investment</em>.  His candidacy is a commitment to a ruling elite, and his promise is that he can show that top 1% of 1% how to stave off any grumblings from the masses.  Romney opened the floodgates of his bank account, and dazzled the insiders.  After a demonstration of his ability "spend money to make money" by milking funds from a long list of pals among the money men, Republican insiders rubbed their hands in joy.  He's the candidate of the money, by the money, for the money. </p> <blockquote> <p>Mr. Romney?s financial support is deep but narrow. He amassed $20 million from fewer than 33,000 donors, according to figures disclosed by his campaign. By comparison, Mr. McCain raised $12.5 million from nearly 50,000 donors while Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, raised $25 million from more than 100,000. Their average contributors each gave about $250; Mr. Romney?s gave more than $600. </p> </blockquote> <p>If you've wondered why Mitt Romney can at once hold a microscopic piece of the general vote, but still win those straw polls among party organizers, stop wondering.  He's sold them a pyramid scheme, bringing every skill honed in avoiding restrictions and taxes on financial investments  to the idea of how a party makes money.  The more you invest, the more you make, and the more you take from the rest of the country.</p>  <p>Democrats worry about "people powered" campaigns, but Romney promises the antithesis of that idea.   </p> <blockquote> <p>.... soon after he was elected governor of Massachusetts, Mr. Romney turned into a fund-raising machine, setting up a series of federal and state political action committees that together let individual donors give far more than the federal campaign spending limits. </p> </blockquote> <p>What has the Republican insiders so glassy-eyed in wonder is the idea that Romney will lead them to the real promised land ? one in which the elite rule unchecked, buoyed along on a sea of unrestricted dollars.  They're unconcerned that his position on social issues changes with every press conference, unfazed that he has less prowess with a rifle than Elmer Fudd, undisturbed by the idea that he may not actually be a conservative (but of course, neither are the Republican insiders).  None of those things matter.  Romney promises more money for those who have money.  That's the beginning, middle, and end of his campaign.</p>  <p>All they need is get the (decreasing number of) Republican voters to follow the plan.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.dailykos.com/~a/dailykos/index?a=Jm1i9y"><img src="http://feeds.dailykos.com/~a/dailykos/index?i=Jm1i9y" border="0"></img></a></p><div class="feedflare"><a href="http://feeds.dailykos.com/~f/dailykos/index?a=Uhi81stQ"><img src="http://feeds.dailykos.com/~f/dailykos/index?i=Uhi81stQ" border="0"></img></a></div>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1175852707;}i:5;a:6:{s:5:"title";s:62:"Romney Continues To Explain His Hunting And Gun Rights History";s:4:"link";s:40:"http://mainehuntingtoday.com/bbb/?p=1934";s:7:"pubdate";s:19:"2007-04-06 06:43:53";s:11:"description";s:3141:"<p>Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, who has raised an estimated $20 million so far in his bid for the White House, continued yesterday in Indiana to explain away his past history as a hunter, his support of the Second Amendment and membership to the NRA.</p><p>Previously, <a href="http://mainehuntingtoday.com/bbb/?p=1929">I had reported</a> that Romney, in a speech in Keene, New Hampshire, told attendees that he was a lifelong hunter and supported gun ownership.
