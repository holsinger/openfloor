Politic2.0 aims to be a resource for political candidates and the general public to understand what internet influencers are saying about candidates and policies. 
Utilizing technology provided by Utah county-based TagJungle, Politic2.0 aggregates blog posts up to the second and analyzes the data for important trends, keywords, 
and topics. WikiReview, a Salt Lake-based internet startup, is the other half of the Politic2.0 equation, allowing users to contribute political opinions in a collaborative 
wiki-type database. Politic2.0 will provide a way to find analytic data on the political trends of both the blogosphere and reviews. <strong>Begin by entering a Politician in the search box above.</strong>
