			bio: "My name is Brady Uselman. A little about me, I grew up in New Mexico and I have lived here in Salt Lake City the last 6 years of my life. I have a wide range of interests and hobbies. I enjoy home construction projects, reading and lately, rock climbing. My fianc√©e and I love to travel, host dinner parties and enjoy all that Utah has to offer.  At the time I was hired by RunPolitics I had just completed my doctoral studies in Physical Chemistry at the University of Utah. Some may ask what interest does RunPolitics have in a Chemist and I in a Web 2.0 company? I have always had an interest in applied science and technology. While I have been interested in Chemistry for some time, I am more interested in the scientific method and the opportunity of applying my skill set to new and dynamic problems. It is my intention to assist in the design and implementation of several RunPolitics upcoming products, enabling the Web 2.0 community to interact in Politics in new and amazing ways."
